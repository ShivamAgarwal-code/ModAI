CIP_38_INSIGHT_PROMPT = """**üìú Sure! Let me walk you through CIP-38, a proposal created by Haris Angelidakis, Andrea Canidio and Felix Henneke, that introduced Solver Computed Fees & Rank by Surplus.**

CIP-38 was essentially about revamping how fees work on the CoW Protocol.

**üîπ Before March 2024:**
When the proposed changes were implemented, users paid fees that went into a pot, and the protocol used those funds to reimburse solvers (the smart algorithms that crunch numbers and find the best trades) for their gas costs. But that system wasn't perfect: most of the time it failed to pass along the surplus from batching orders to the end users and required CoW to constantly monitor solvers.

**‚ú® What the authors proposed:**
Instead of the protocol handling all these fees, they suggested letting solvers collect their own "network fees" directly. This means they'd charge exactly what they need to cover their gas costs, no more, no less. And the best thing was that, according to the authors, competition among solvers ensured they didn't overcharge.

What's more, the authors suggested a change in the mechanism of "protocol fees" introduced in CIP-34 (ask me if you need context on that!). Authors suggested that Solvers would collect this fee on behalf of the CoW DAO (that's us!) and pay it out in COW tokens. According to the authors, it gives the token real utility and creates demand, which could boost its value.

**To sum up, the authors claim that their proposal:**
‚Ä¢ Simplifies everything by cutting out middleman steps
‚Ä¢ Encourages fair competition among solvers
‚Ä¢ Boosts the value of COW tokens

**Analysis:**
On one hand, this proposal simplifies the fee structure dramatically, reduces overhead for the protocol, and introduces a new use case for the COW token. On the other hand, there are legitimate concerns about solver behavior ‚Äî if left unchecked, they might exploit their power to set fees, potentially harming users or smaller solvers."""

CIP_38_COMMUNITY_PROMPT = """
üí¨ Here are some of the most valuable discussion points that were voiced by the community: 
**copiumnicus** üßë‚Äçüíª (X: @copiumnicus, known as Copium Capital, solver in CoW Swap) generally supported the proposal, but voiced some criticism: 
‚Ä¢ **COW payments** üí∞: @copiumnicus pointed out that requiring solvers to pay in COW could expose solvers to large losses due to the token's volatility. He suggested accepting fees in ETH instead. 
‚Ä¢ **Data availability** üìä: in order to self-configure fees, solvers need higher data availability for the auctions that are happening. He proposes that the auctions are immediately available through API not 64 blocks later when they are finalized. 
**AndreaC** üë®‚Äçüî¨ (X: @AndreaCanidio, research economist in CoWSwap) replied to the criticism: 
‚Ä¢ **COW payments** üí∏: @AndreaCanidio pointed out that CoW DAO will also specify the currency in which fees are computed. It can be ETH or any other currency. However, independently of that currency, the payment should occur in COW. 
‚Ä¢ **Data availability** üìà: @AndreaCanidio agreed that @copiumnicus has a good point. However, he mentioned that solvers should already have the auction ID as part of the instance, which can be used to look up auction data.

COW_SWAP_SOLVER_PROMPT = """üîÑ **Solver Competition on CoW Swap** 
üí° Solver competition is one of the most important features on CoW Swap. 
üîπ CoW Protocol groups user orders into batches and auctions them off to bonded third parties known as solvers to execute. 
Then, solvers simulate solutions to the batch and then bid against each other in a batch auction for the right to execute the transactions onchain. 
üèÜ CoW Protocol currently has the largest solver network of any intents-based trading platform. To learn more about solvers, you can check out our docs 
(https://docs.cow.fi/cow-protocol/concepts/introduction/solvers) or Dune dashboard (https://dune.com/cowprotocol/solver-info) 
üìú **Recent Community Proposals** 
In the last 6 months, there have been several community proposals that changed the way solvers operate: 
‚Ä¢  **CIP-57**: Solver rewards on all chains 
‚Ä¢  **CIP-55**: Slashing of the GlueX Protocol solver and the CoW DAO bonding pool 
‚ùì Want me to elaborate on one of them?"""
